After a lot of very difficult and sanity bending work, it is finally finished: the project has reached a satisfactory state and is now ready for public use.

# What is the BromA Mission Framework?

The BromA Mission Framework (referred to from now on as "BMF") is simply put a collection of scripts - most made in-house, some adapted - designed to function together, bringing essential functions to ArmA missions with minimal effort on part of the mission maker, regardless of past experience or level of scripting expertise.
While the BMF is designed to include the vast majority of common features, mission makers are invited to customize and disable modules as desired, with many modules included as session-unique Parameters for an increased replayability factor.

**Perks of the BMF include but not limited to:**

* **Designed for concision and practicality**
* **Easy AI management with DAC integration**
* **Time Limit**
* **Limit for civilian casualties**
* **Customizable ending screens**
* **Spawn protection**

**... and much more.**

# Usage and application

The BMF is designed first and foremost with simplicity and cohesion in mind: in order to make a regular Destroy and Capture mission, the user will only need to customize his own parameters and place the AI zones wherever desired and adjust the player units with gear - the underlying work is already finished and tested.

Using the BMF is very simple:


* Download the lastest version from this git repository.
* Unpack the folder named "broma_framework_final_ver07.desert_e" to your default missions folder, generally located at ```Documents\ArmA 2 Other Profiles\YourUserName\Missions```
* If you wish to use another map, [refer to this guide](http://ferstaberinde.com/f2/en/index.php?title=Using_F2_with_other_islands).
* Start customizing your mission.

[i]Note from Nife: I have to apologize for the lack of direct documentation: recently I've been running BromA only with the help of a few people and it's been taking a lot of my time. If you have any questions related to the Framework, I'm always available to answer them - but until then that is all help I can afford to offer.[/i]

I really really really really recommend you use the [url=http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=14714]SQF Editor[/url] to edit your missions; it has an built-in synthax check and command lookup for all of ArmA's variables and functions, which proves to be invaluable.

As stated previously, the BMF is a compilation - a mashup of several different scripts and modules - modified and adapted to function together without any conflicts. Naturally, it is  imperative to recognize the absolutely amazing work of the authors of these scripts.
